    "- If you'd like to download data using a GUI, [Select+Build](https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-government/products/os-select-build), allows you to download multiple types of features at once, delivered as part of the [OS Data Hub](https://osdatahub.os.uk).\n",

    "For Python developers, the [`osdatahub`](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/osdatahub) Python library wraps almost all APIs in the [OS Data Hub](https://osdatahub.os.uk/) and provides an easy, Pythonic way to get data from Ordnance Survey.
